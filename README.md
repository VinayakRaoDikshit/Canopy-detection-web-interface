# Canopy-detection-web-interface
A simple, small scale web interface for urban tree canopy detection using satellite &amp; aerial imagery.

Currently, my aim is to design a simple UI for uploading the aerial imagery data using Full stack technologies (although Tkinter can also be utilised) . Moving forward, the UI will be connected to the deep forest model using Flask in the backend. Due to time constraints, I am planning to use the pre existing deep forest model <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gKUiocwfCvcvVfiKzAaf6voiUVL2KK_r?usp=sharing#scrollTo=QWVU32TqoKWY"> here. </a>
